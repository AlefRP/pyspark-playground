Hi there! Welcome to **PySpark Playground**! This is a collection of PySpark examples I put together while learning Apache Spark. I wanted to document my journey, share my progress, and hopefully help others get started with Spark too. 

## 🌟 Why I Made This

When I started exploring Apache Spark, I realized how powerful it is for working with big data. But, like anything new, it felt a bit overwhelming at first. So, I decided to create simple, hands-on examples that make it easier to understand the basics. This repository is my way of sharing what I’ve learned so far.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes a short tutorial in the notebook: **`pyspark_tutorial_with_examples.ipynb`**. It’s packed with practical examples using an ice cream sales dataset—because who doesn’t love ice cream?

### 🛠️ What’s Inside:
- **Getting Started**: Learn how to set up Apache Spark and PySpark in Google Colab.
- **DataFrame Basics**: Examples of selecting columns, filtering rows, adding calculated columns, and grouping data.
- **Popular Functions**: Hands-on with PySpark’s most-used transformations, like “withColumn”, “groupBy”, and aggregations (e.g., average, sum).
- **Unique IDs**: See how to generate unique IDs for rows using “monotonically_increasing_id”.
- **SQL Magic**: Combine SQL with PySpark to run custom transformations.
- **Real-Life Data**: Follow along with an ice cream sales dataset for practical use cases.
- **Extra Tricks**: Work with dates, timestamps, and other cool features.

## 🚀 How to Use This

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlefRP/pyspark-playground.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook **`pyspark_tutorial_with_examples.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the examples, tweak the code, and see what happens—learning by doing is the best way!

## 📚 My Go-To Resources

While I tried to keep this tutorial as clear as possible, Spark’s official documentation has been a lifesaver for me. If you want to dive deeper, I highly recommend checking it out:
- [Apache Spark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)

## 🤔 Why You Should Check This Out

- It’s beginner-friendly (I’m a beginner too!).
- Focuses on hands-on learning with fun, real-world examples.
- Shows how to use PySpark in environments like Google Colab.

I hope this helps you get started with PySpark and makes your learning journey a bit easier. Let’s explore big data together!
